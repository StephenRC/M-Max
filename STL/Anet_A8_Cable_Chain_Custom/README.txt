# Summary

UPDATED! Open cable chain links and clip. Clip design adapted from schnuffi's design and slapped onto my thinned variation of the cable chain by sukhoi27

I included the X Axis extruder end and motor mount by The_Random_Engineer which I plan on tweeking in a later date.

Thinning the cable chain made by sukhoi27 and chamfering the inner chain edge for ease of assembly. I also cleaned up the Y-Bed bracket of unnecessary geometry and thinned the wall to fit the profile of my chain.

I mounted it to my Anet A8 using M4.7x12mm screws and nuts. Though the nuts probably weren't needed and you may be able to get away without using screws like Papinist did with his thinned bracket design. I just like it sturdy.

I also added holes to the Y-Bed bracket to accommodate a zip tie to act as a strain relief for the wires which I soldered directly to the board (14ga.). Holding them in place securely.

P.S. After installation I started hearing squeaking. After much searching and fear of bad bearings, I found out it was the cable chain. So if you too hear squeaking check to see if it is the cable chain before you freak out!

P.P.S On the subject of the X-Axis motor mount my Anet's  hex screws were too short to reach the motor through its mount and that bracket. I used the longer Phillips screws that came with my printer and carved out the lower screw hole so that the standard hex screw would just slide into the hole no problem. I plan on reworking the design as such and shortening the Z-axis adjustment screw bracket. Currently, you'll need a longer screw and to tap the hole for an M3 screw or *as I did* just work the screw in and it'll carve the threads itself but that is difficult.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .15-.2
Infill: n/a

Notes: 
Supports needed to print the X-Axis motor mount properly! 

I set my printer to print 2mm walls and the chain links ended up printing solid when infill was set to default 20% so infill is not needed.

PLA @ 210°C
60°C heated bed
60mm-sec print speed.

No support was used.

# Post-Printing

Flush cutters will help get all the stringing off. Sanding the angled shoulder on the open end may help for smooth operation. Also assembling the chain and flexing the whole thing vigorously for a bit will help smooth out the joint for ease of operation!
