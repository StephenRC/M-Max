# Summary

I was having a hard time finding a spool holder that would attach to my printer easily and still keep the printer footprint small, so I created this. It attaches with one screw and T-nut and will hold a Hatchbox roll or smaller. Enjoy!

UPDATE!!
Version 2.2
I bored out the screw mounting hole and added a larger tab to the end of the spool rod so if someone wants to mount it vertically, it will still hold a roll of filament.

UPDATE!!
Version 2.3
I changed my configuration around on my printer and needed a way to mount this on the top of my printer so I added a bigger end so it can now hold a spool when mounted in any direction. I also made the spool rod round so there is less drag when mounted in different configurations.

# Print Settings

Printer: Tevo Tarantula
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .3
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I did mine at .3mm and 20% infil and it seems rigid enough. The finer resolution you go and the higher infil will only make it stronger.
