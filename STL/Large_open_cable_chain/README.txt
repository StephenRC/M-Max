# Summary

I needed a cable chain for large cables, but didn't wanted to use much plastic for it. So I ended up with this remix (thanks for the original design!) :)

This is an open design. You can use it with the provided clip, or you can also lock the chain with zip ties.

The chain is 12mm large and 16mm high with the clip.
Both ends are provided.
